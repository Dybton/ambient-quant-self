WIP

I am building a dashboard designed to serve as my personalized homescreen on Google Chrome. This  dashboard provides me with data pertaining to my health and work habits, enabling me to make informed decisions and achieve optimal health and productivity.

The dashboard showcases several key metrics, including the distance I have run run, the duration of my sleep, the amount of time I have spent on undesired websites, and the number of hours dedicated to deep work. I am building it in TypeScript, React, Node.js, and GraphQL

To get the sleep and fitness data, I have integrated the backend with the Oura API, using REST to establish a connection and retrieve relevant information. Additionally, I have developed a custom Chrome extension that tracks the time spent on specific websites, helping me limit distractions and increase my focus on important tasks.

To store the deep work data, I have implemented a straightforward JSON database, ensuring reliable data storage and retrieval.

To connect the backend to the front-end, I am using graphQL. 

Overall, this dashboard represents the culmination of my expertise as a software engineer, bringing together cutting-edge technologies and APIs to provide a comprehensive overview of my health and work habits. Its user-friendly interface and robust functionality make it an indispensable tool for optimizing productivity and achieving personal goals.
